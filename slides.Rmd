.h4[If you want to get started with Git **now**.]

Here, we will focus on the tools you _actually_ need to start working collaboratively and putting your work under version control.

Git is extremely powerful and there are myriad sophisticated things you can do with it. As a result, the [`r fa("book", fill = "#d49a89")` documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is very thorough, but can often be overwhelming `r emo::ji("exploding_head")` if you are just starting.

# Why you should use Git

### Spillover benefits

`r emo::ji("man_scientist")` `r emo::ji("ruler")` It imposes a certain discipline to your programming.

`r emo::ji("nerd_face")` `r emo::ji("fire")` You can be braver when you code: if your new feature breaks, you can revert back to a version that worked!

`r emo::ji("coder")` `r emo::ji("box")` Keeps multiple (older and newer) versions of everything (not just source code)

# Git and GitHub

.h4[Git]

- the software that allows us to do version control. 

- like the “Track Changes” feature from Microsoft Word, but more rigorous, powerful, and scaled up to multiple files.


.h4[GitHub] 

- hosting service for git projects — essentially Dropbox for git projects.

- You can host **remote** repositories on https://github.com/. You edit and work on your content in your **local** repository on your computer, and then you send your changes to the remote.


You can interact with Git using the **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** provided by GitHub Desktop, or through the **Command Line Interface (CLI)**. 


.h4[In this tutorial, we will use both.]

# Setting up git environment 

<br>

.h4[As a first-time set up, you need to tell Git who you are.]

Enter these lines (with appropriate changes):

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git config --global user.name "Javed Ali"
git config --global user.email "javedali@knights.ucf.edu"
```

- Make sure that you include here the same email you used for signing up on GitHub.

Test if this worked by typing
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git config --list
```

.h4[You only need to do this once.]

---
# SSH key generation & setup

--
**Step 1.** Check if your computer is already connected to GitHub

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ssh -T git@github.com
```
- If it gives an error, then you're not connected.

<br>

--

**Step 2.** Check what key pairs already exist on your computer.
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls -al ~/.ssh
```
- If SSH has been set up on the computer you’re using, the public and private key pairs will be listed. The file names are either `id_ed25519`/`id_ed25519.pub` or `id_rsa`/`id_rsa.pub` depending on how the key pairs were set up.

--

**Step 3.** If they don’t exist on your computer, use this command to create them.
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your email address"
```

---
<br><br><br>

**Step 4.** Now that we have generated the SSH keys, we will find the SSH files when we check.
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ls -al ~/.ssh
```
<br>
--

**Step 5.** Copy the public key to GitHub
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
<br>
--

**Step 6.**  Now that we’ve set that up, let’s check our authentication again from the command line.
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
ssh -T git@github.com
```

It should say, 
```{bash eval=FALSE}
Hi <Your Name>! You have successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

# Using GitHub Desktop


---
# The basic workflow 

### First time
1. **Clone** the repository that you want to work on from GitHub onto your local machine

2. Work on the files/scripts

3. Next, you will **commit** your changes and include an informative message, e.g. "Plot distribution of precipitation"

4. Then, you will **push** your changes to the remote repository

### Subsequent times
1. **Pull** any changes from the remote repository that your collaborators might have made

2. Repeat steps 2-4 above


---

# Working with GitHub

<br>

There are two ways to work with GitHub projects.


**Type 1:** 

- Create the repository on GitHub, clone it to your PC, and work on it. **(Recommended)**

<br>

**Type 2:** 

- Work on your project locally then create the repository on GitHub and push it to remote.

# Commit your changes

.h4[Use an informative commit message]
  - (Not great) "Analyze data" `r emo::ji("disappointed")`
  - (Better) "Estimate logistic regression" `r emo::ji("tada")`

.h4[Have a consistent style]
  - Start with an action verb
  - Capitalize message

.h4[Commits are _cheap_, use them often!]

# Using the command line (CLI)




---

# Working on local machine

.h4[Clone the repository]

```bash
git clone URL
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/javedali99/git-tutorial.git
```

.h4[Stage your files]
```bash
git add .
```

.h4[Commit your changes]
```bash
git commit -m "Add example code"
```

.h4[Push your changes]
```bash
git push
```

# More command line tips

---
# git status

.h4[Use this to check at what stage of the workflow you are at.]

_This happens when you have modified the script, but haven't staged your changes yet._

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git status
```

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
{{Changes not staged for commit:}}
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        {{modified:   file.py}}
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```



---
# git status

_After you stage the `file.py` file, but before you commit the changes._

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git add file.py
git status
```

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
{{Changes to be committed:}}
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   file.py
```


.h4[When your local repository is in sync with the remote.]

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git status
```

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
{{nothing to commit, working tree clean}}
```



---
# git pull

Your collaborators have been adding some awesome content to the repository, and you want to fetch their changes from the remote and update your local repository.

.h4[Use this to fetch changes from the remote and to merge them in to your local repository.]

```bash
git pull
```
What this is doing under-the-hood is running a `git fetch` and then `git merge`.



---
# Adding and ignoring files

To stage specific files in your repository, you can name them directly

```bash
git add file.py other-script.py
```
or you can add all of them at once

```bash
git add .
```

You might want to _not_ track certain files in your local repository, e.g., sensitive files such as credentials. But it might get tedious to type out each file that you _do_ want to include by name.

.h4[Use a .gitignore file to specify files to always ignore.]

Create a file called `.gitignore` and place it in your repo. The content of the file should include the names of the files that you want Git to **not track**.



---
# git log

.h4[Use this to look at the history of your repository.]

Each commit has a specific **hash** that identifies it.

```bash
git log
```

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
{{commit af58f79bfa4301643025dd6c8767e65349cf407a}}
Author: Name <Email address>
Date:   DD-MM-YYYY
    Add file script
```

You can also find this on GitHub, by going to [github.com/user-name/repo-name/commits](https://github.com/javedali99/git-tutorial/commits).

.h4[You can go back in time to a specific commit, if you know its reference.]



---
# Undoing mistakes

Imagine you did some work, **committed** the changes, and **pushed** them to the remote repo. But you'd like to undo those changes.

.h4[Running `git revert` is a "soft undo".]

Say you added some plain text by mistake to `file.py`. Running `git revert` will do the opposite of what you just did (i.e., remove the plain text) and create a new commit. You can then `git push` this to the remote.

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git revert <hash-of-the-commit-you-want-to-undo>
git push
```



---
# Undoing mistakes

`git revert` is the safest option to use.

.h4[It will preserve the history of your commits.]

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
git log
```

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
commit 6634a076212fb7bac16f9525feae1e83e0f200ca
Author: Name <Email address>
Date:   DD-MM-YYYY
    {{Revert "Add plain text to code by mistake"}}
    {{This reverts commit a8cf7c2592273ef6a28920222a92847794275868.}}
commit a8cf7c2592273ef6a28920222a92847794275868
Author: Name <Email address>
Date:   DD-MM-YYYY
    Add plain text to code by mistake
```
